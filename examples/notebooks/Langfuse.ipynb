    "# Tracing Koog Agents to Langfuse with OpenTelemetry\n",

    "This notebook shows how to export Koog agent traces to your Langfuse instance using OpenTelemetry. You'll set up environment variables, run a simple agent, and then inspect spans and traces in Langfuse.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
