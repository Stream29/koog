 *
 * @property model The identifier of the Anthropic model to be used for processing the request.
 * @property messages A list of messages constituting the dialogue. Each message contains a role and corresponding content.
 * @property maxTokens The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. Defaults to 2048.
 * @property temperature The sampling temperature for adjusting randomness in generation. Higher values increase randomness.
 * @property system An optional list of system-level messages defining additional context or instructions.
 * @property tools An optional list of tools that the Anthropic model can utilize during processing.
 * @property stream Whether responses should be returned as a stream. Defaults to false.
 * @property toolChoice An optional specification for tool selection during processing, which may define automatic, specific, or no tool usage.
