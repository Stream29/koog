/**
 * Represents a server responsible for managing and facilitating communication of feature messages.
 * Typically used for sending and handling messages within a remote server context.
 *
 * A server is a pat of a Kotlin AI Agent.
 * The server is started inside the same process as the running agent.
 * It is used to broadcast agent execution events to connected clients (e.g., a running IDE).
 * Please see description for a client in [ai.koog.agents.core.feature.remote.client.FeatureMessageRemoteClient].
 *
 * Features:
 *   - Send SSE events [FeatureMessage] during agent execution;
 *   - Process incoming messages from a client;
 *   - Respond to client's health check requests to verify connection state.

     * - `true` if the server is running and ready to process incoming connections or events.
     * - `false` if the server is stopped or has not yet been started.
     *
     * The value of `isStarted` is updated automatically based on the server's lifecycle transitions,
     * such as when starting or stopping the server.
     *
     * This property can be used to monitor the server's state, ensuring that its operations
     * are executed only when it is in the appropriate running state.
     * It is particularly useful for preventing redundant start operations or for providing feedback to the client.
