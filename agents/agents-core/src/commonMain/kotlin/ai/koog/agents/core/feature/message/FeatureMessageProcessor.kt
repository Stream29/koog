 *   - node finished
 *   - strategy started, etc.

 * Implementations of this interface are designed to process feature messages,
 * which are encapsulated in the [FeatureMessage] type and presented as a model
 * for an event to be sent to a target stream. These messages carry
 * information about various events or updates related to features in the system.
