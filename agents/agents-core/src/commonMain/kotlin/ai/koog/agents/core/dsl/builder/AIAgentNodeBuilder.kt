/**
 * A builder class for constructing instances of [AIAgentNodeBase] with specific behavior and attributes.
 *
 * This class is responsible for managing the configuration of an AI agent node, including its name
 * and execution logic. It provides a mechanism for defining a unit of execution that operates
 * within the context of an AI agent, linking an input type [Input] to an output type [Output].
 *
 * @param Input The type of input data the node will process.
 * @param Output The type of output data the node will produce.
 * @constructor Used internally to create a new builder with the provided execution logic.
 * @param execute A suspending function to define the execution logic of the node. This function will be called
 * in the scope of [AIAgentContextBase], where it has access to the AI agent's context and tools relevant
 * to its operation.
